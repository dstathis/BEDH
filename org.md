# BEDH Organization

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to create an EDH format that is as fun and balanced as possible. The format will aim to satisfy players at a wide range of competition levels, though it will not consider the highest and lowest levels of competition.

## Governance
This format will have a council which votes on any changes to BEDH. A vote of 80% will be required to make a change to the rules document. A vote of 100% will be required to make changes to the Organization document.

## Current Council Members
Dylan Stephano-Shachter
